Environment Variable Parsing in Go

This is a simple library to parse environment variables and allow the option to provide a default. Honestly,
I think the best way to use this library is to copy the method(s) you need into your own project. I'd hate to
see go become like node.js with libraries for simple string paddings. ðŸ˜€
